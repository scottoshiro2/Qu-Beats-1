# Qu-Beats v2.0

This is similar to the 1st version of Qu-Beats but now you can entangle more complex midi drum patterns and entangle them to generate new patterns. This can run on both the aer-simulator and real quantum computers.

Also one entire drum loop can be considered for each execution of one circuit rather than running the quantum circuit for each subdivision of the midi pattern. (Read Me under construction).
